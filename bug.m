In Objective-C, a tricky error can occur when dealing with memory management and object lifecycles, especially when using delegates or blocks.  The problem arises when an object is deallocated prematurely, while another object still holds a strong reference to it. This leads to a crash with the dreaded EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyDelegate : NSObject <MyProtocol>
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyObject *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyDelegate
- (void)someMethod { [self.myObject doSomething]; }
@end

@interface MyObject : NSObject
- (void)doSomething; 
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)doSomething { NSLog (@"Doing something"); }
@end
```
If `myObject` is deallocated before `someMethod` is called, accessing `self.myObject` results in a crash. This might happen if `myObject`'s lifecycle is not properly managed or if the delegate is retained beyond its intended lifetime.
