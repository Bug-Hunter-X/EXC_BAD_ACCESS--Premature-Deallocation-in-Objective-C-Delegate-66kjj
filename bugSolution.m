To fix the bug, use a weak reference to `myObject` within the delegate:

```objectivec
@interface MyDelegate : NSObject <MyProtocol>
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObject *myObject;
@end
```
By using `weak`, the delegate doesn't retain the object. The object's lifecycle is managed independently, preventing premature deallocation errors.  It's crucial to understand the implications of strong and weak references in Objective-C memory management.   Always carefully consider object lifecycles and use weak references where appropriate to avoid EXC_BAD_ACCESS crashes.
